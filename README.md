My-Portfolio

**Introduction**

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project serves as a platform to showcase my skills, projects, and experience as a freelance designer. I am planning on showcasing this website to future potential employers.
The website features at least three pages:

*Home*
- An introduction to who I am and my professional background.

*Portfolio*
- A collection of my work, highlighting design projects I have completed. I will also include a link to a page for future web development projects. If there is not enough time to complete all pages in the portfolio I will link to a "coming soon" page.

*Contact*
- A contact form and a success page for potential clients and collaborators to reach out to me.

**User Stories**

I have included below user stories to implement on the website, the acceptance criteria and the tasks needed for development of the site. The user stories are to be set up in a github project collaboration page and labelled with must-have, should-have and could-have labels to plan for the process. Once the wabsite is finished it needs to have at least all user stories with the labels must-have and should-have signed off and implemented on the website.
