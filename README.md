My-Portfolio

**Introduction**
Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project serves as a platform to showcase my skills, projects, and experience as a freelance designer. I am planning on showcasing this website to future potential employers.
The website features three pages:
*Home*
An introduction to who I am and my professional background.
*Portfolio*
A collection of my work, highlighting design projects I have completed. I will also include a link to a page for future web development projects. If there is not enough time to complete all pages in the portfolio I will link to a "coming soon" page.
*Contact*
A contact form and a success page for potential clients and collaborators to reach out to me.
